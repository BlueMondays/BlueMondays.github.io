Dear Apple, the current released version has critical issues concerning user experience,
such as user can't use the main menu because it is not visible.
The reason behind this is that the app is not optimized at iOS 11.2.
For users currently using iOS 11.2, the Constraint is crashed and the main menu is not visible, so users can not use multiple services.
We often receive sad reviews because they want to use it more, but the app can not keep up with the user,
often terminating into a bad impression towards our service.
We have promised our users that we will improve every aspect of the service,
make their experience better than ever, and release this on ASAP,
the best we could do to launch this as quick as possible.
We want to meet beyond their expectation,
so we sincerely ask for your cooperation to review this new binary so that we can release this on time.
Thank you very much for your time and help.
